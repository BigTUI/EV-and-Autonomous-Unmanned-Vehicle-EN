The Story: I had the opportunity to see a 60-ton electric dump truck equipped with an autonomous driving system (EV and Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle Truck 60 Tons). I visited China privately with P'Pi (Mr.Piyapong Woarakee) , Assistant Governor – Information Technology. Since P'Pi has some connections with Huawei, we arranged to coordinate with Yutong, a company that manufactures various types of electric vehicles. However, we specifically wanted to observe their dump truck (Haul Truck) system that uses electric power and an autonomous driving system. Initially, we knew that Yutong had collaborated with SCG and AIS to implement this autonomous system at SCG’s site in a quarry in Saraburi Province, but it was not yet operational. Thus, we couldn’t visit the site (according to AIS, it may be available for viewing in Q4 of 2024). We were informed that the mining technology uses 5G and an automated vehicle control system (today, we finally saw the real system in action).

On the first day, we visited the Operation Control Center. We observed the development of a fully integrated ecosystem that connects "Vehicles-Energy-Road-Cloud" to create social value with new products and bring the mining industry into a new era of intelligent development. The ecosystem of the mining site includes the following components:
Collaborative Cloud: A cloud-based control platform that integrates communication with 5G technology.
The Road to Wisdom: Data monitoring and analysis of various factors from smart control stations along the vehicle route.
Smart Car: Pure electric vehicles powered by new energy, with unmanned driving capability.
Reliable Performance: New energy systems and smart energy management applications.

Control Room Image: Normally, there are 3-4 operators in the control room (to manage the 19 autonomous vehicles) and one team member on-site (in case of emergencies). The room is equipped with one remote system for long-distance vehicle control and approximately three computers for general management tasks.

Field Visit: The video footage shows the unmanned dump truck in action. If you observe closely, you will notice that the vehicle consistently follows the same path.

This image demonstrates the ability to remotely control the vehicle (Manual Mode), with all the relevant information displayed on the screen.

Charger Station: This is a fast-charging station that takes about 40 minutes, allowing the vehicle to operate for approximately three cycles. The manufacturer mentioned that the system could be adjusted according to customer requirements. Each cabinet has two outlets, and as shown in the image, it can charge six vehicles simultaneously.
